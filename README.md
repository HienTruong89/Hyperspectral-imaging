# Hyperspectral-imaging 
- Segementation 
- Object detection/extraction
  To work with hyperspectral imaging, segmentation is often the first step to remove unnecessary information from the region of interest (ROI).
  In this demo, the case study of hyperspectral images on food is observed. 
  Python code is developed to segregate the background, noise, and saturation light.
